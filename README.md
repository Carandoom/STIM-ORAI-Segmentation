# Small Object Segmentation

Initially made to perform a segmentation on TIRF images of STIM/ORAI puncta over time during thapsigargin stimulation.
The script works in ImageJ/Fiji and uses the local maxima of the fluorescence intensity of the puncta associated with a threshold to do a segmentation of each puncta for each timepoint.

/!\ This script is not performing tracking of the segmented structure over time.

Example of the script working script: [Puncta Segmentation](https://youtu.be/QEaP-abz-Ic)
