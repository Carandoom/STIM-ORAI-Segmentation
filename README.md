# Small Object Segmentation [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/373828941.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/373828941)

Initially made to perform a segmentation on TIRF images of STIM/ORAI puncta over time during thapsigargin stimulation.
The script works in ImageJ/Fiji and uses the local maxima of the fluorescence intensity of the puncta associated with a threshold to do a segmentation of each puncta for each timepoint.

/!\ This script is not performing tracking of the segmented structure over time.
